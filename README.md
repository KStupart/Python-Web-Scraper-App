# Python Web Scraper App
My first project in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. I would have gotten nowhere if it wasn't for the help of [Real Python's Blog](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/).
The application still needs more tweaking but I think this is a good point to stop at.

Thanks to [Dan Shahin's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvPOUdz5PL4) on how to post an image to a github readme

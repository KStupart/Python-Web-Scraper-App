# Python-Web-Scraper-App
My first project in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. I would have gotten nowhere if it wasn't for the help of [Real Python's Blog](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/).
The application still needs more tweaking but I think this is a good point to stop at.
